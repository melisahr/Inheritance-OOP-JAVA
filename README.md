# Inheritance-OOP-JAVA
Language:Java

I follow along a YouTube video to understand inheritance.

Inheritance is the process to in where the subclass can inherit the attributes and methods of the superclass.
There are three classes: Vehicle, Car, and Bicycle. The Vehicle is the superclass(parent class) while the subclass 
(child class) are Car and Bicycle. The goal is for the subclass to inherits the properties from the superclass without
rewritting the code twice.

How?
Create the attribute and method in the superclass.
In the subclass file, use the keyword "extends" to inherit from the Vehicle.
